# Workflux

Are you tired of trying to use dor-services to access dor-workflow-service for an inconveniently attached remotely hosted
datastream composed on the fly by an inconsistent Java application written 8 years ago?  Yeah, me too.

All it is in one table.  Well, one table and a rolloff because having 80 Million rows degrades performance.

## TODO

- Normalize database at least to one level
- Model the associations
